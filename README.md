# qgate-mlrun
Quality Gate for solution MLRun and Iguazio. The main aims of the project are:
- independent test quality (function, integration, acceptance, performance, ... tests) of new MLRun/Iguazio versions
- cover gaps in tests which MLRun/Iguazio does not cover
- identification of compatibility issues
- automatization
- etc.

The tests use these key components:
 - MLRun solution (used in Iguazio solution also), see **[GIT MLRun](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun)**
 - sample data model, see **[GIT qgate-fs-model](https://github.com/george0st/qgate-fs-model)**
 - etc.
